Firstly the _STONE_5_right stone_ moves into the square occupied by the  _STONE_4_left stone_, and the left stone is only afterwards pushed out.

For example, if the stone is an early \"ancestor\" in a long world-line of stones, removing it during canonisation necessarily removes all the children, too (unless you link onto a later point in the world-line with... exactly, <i>swapping</i> again). Also, creating a closed loop means you have a stone on board which may be doing something useful without requiring another of your stones to \"become it\", which is, if you think about it, the only way to truly \"increase\" the number of stones in your army.\r\n</p>"
