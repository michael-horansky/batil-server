div board_control_panel is a left sidebar which has a fixed width of 150px and fills the entire available space vertically.

div board_window is the element which provides "springiness" to the document, since both its width and height are adjusted depending on the browser dimensions. Specifically, board_window fills the entire available width and height! It contains only a single element, which is an svg environment which also fills the entire parent.

divs game_control_panel, game_log, and game_management fill the entire height and width of the gameside div in the following way: game_log has a fixed width of 200px, and game_control panel and game_management have equal widths.
